# About me
*I have lots of ideas; they just can't all be bangers*

## Hi There!

I'm Kyle and what really butters my buns is finding and building solutions through automation to help others focus on things they care about. I'm passionate about empowering others and ensuing that these solutions are accessible. I like to work in small increments and get feedback early.  I'm not afraid to try something and throw it out if it isn't the right solution.  They can't all be bangers after all.

## Projects / What have I been up to

Currently, I'm the Lead Senior Software Engineer in the Developer Services group for 3M Platform Engineering.  
*Ok, But what does that actually mean?*  
 In practicality I do all sorts. Some days I'm neck deep writing code for our next feature, others I'm illustrating the visions for the next generation of tooling for 3M's software teams. Other days, I'm leading a diverse team to make those visions a reality, and more frequently find ways for those individuals to reach their professional goals.  All while applying the Company's values, as well as my own to the solutions. 

- Everyone can and should write code.
- Actively cast users into the pit of success.
- Use right tool for the job.

most recently, I've been working to relieve pain and accelerate developer teams in 3M.  Each project required that I quickly ramp up on the new tools and technologies.  The basic patten I would follow would be to setup a POC/POV, design the product architecture, build the breakdown of stories to be completed, and finally divvy out and guide a team to complete the work.  In 2023 that involved 3 main solutions. 

- Prototype, architect, and own the next generation of DevOps practices used by dozens of development teams. 
- Lead and contribute to a library of reusable, compliant by default, cloud constructs 
- Automation to accelerate adoption of security tooling and make it as easy as possible for identified vulnerabilities to be connected with the developers best equipped to address them 

But none of this work was done in a vacuum or by myself.  Today, I serve as the technical leader of the team of 7 developers. Each at a different point in their career.  A few of them have been in the industry for 15+ years, who I often seek out for "sniff tests" to make sure the bits I'm coming up with aren't complete shit. We recently had an individual join our team in the middle of a career change who if very new to software development. Their grit to learn everyday is an inspiration. Frankly, their journey is a great test of my conviction that anyone can code and the tools we create should be intuitive as possible. Outside of my immediate team, I work with my direct manager and other leaders to mesh our priorities with theirs. More frequently this means having challenging conversation to reevaluate the status quo and, in some cases, strongly encourage individuals to modernize.

## Tools and other bits

Frankly, my intention with this section is to serve as a catalyst for a conversation.  Below are some of the technologies I've been recently using and some ways I've applied them. Some of them are a good fit for some things, or no so much.

## My goals

A goal I have set for myself is to be in a position to make an impact. I get my kicks on solving problems. Nothing gets me more jazzed then when I can see how some solution I created or had a part of makes their life better.  More recently in my career my time has been increasingly spent talking to folks about getting things done than actually acting.  

Other more concrete goals are to obtain my Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified Cloud Security Professional (CSSP) Certifications. These will help to demonstrate the knowledge I've built from years in the industry while also finding the gaps in my knowledge.  

## About me

I'm live White Bear Lake Minnesota with my wife, 2 cats, and dog. Lindsay, Mendle, Ruby, and Zero.  I'm originally from Clare MI, and went to college at Central Michigan University. There I earned my undergrad in Business Information Systems with a minor in IT. There I landed an Internship at 3M, got a job offer, and there I be. 

In my free time I like to play video games with my childhood friends, now strewn across the country, but more recently I've taken up game development as a creative outlet.  Less frequently than I'd like, I also enjoy back packing and the yearly dirt bike trip to Michigan Upper Peninsula.  Finally with what ever time I have left, I am working on house projects.  Because there are always house projects to be done.
