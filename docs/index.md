"I have lots of ideas; they just can't all be bangers" - KG

## Hi There!

I'm Kyle and what really butters my buns finding and building solutions through automation to help others focus on things they care about. I'm passionate about empowering others and ensuing that these solutions are accessible. I like to work in small increments and get feedback early.  I'm not afraid to try something and throw it out if it isn't the right solution.  They can't all be bangers after all.

## What I've been up to?

Mainly bouncing around 3M IT for the last 9 years, contributing to different projects as needed. Some of the them are listed below. 

### Developer Accessibility
For each unique project, there is a unique team of people.  Each person bringing their own experiences and skill set. I have worked with interns only 2 years into a degree and grey beards who were there at the beginning. In the following project I've implemented several different strategies and landed on a few core bits I aim for. 

#### Pit of success mindset
#### Time to hitting the first breakpoint
#### Use the right tool for the job

### Construct Library
The problem this project aimed to solve was ever increasing complexity of requirements to run an AWS resource in a 3M way.  The solution that was build is what we call the construct library and was a means to cast a developer into a pit of success. Using the [AWS Cloud Developer Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html), a, infrastructure as Code library, as our based,  we extended the resources definitions to include the 3M defaults. That way when you define an S3 bucket in you IAC, then you get one that prebaked with all the 3M defaults and the developer gets their bucket. So instead of focusing on making sure the they have the right tags, they can get back to their own work. 

I've handled this project from the prototype I created, to leading the a dev team to build it out, to driving it's adoption.  The library is primarily written in Typescript, the native language of AWS CDK and made it available as a NPM package through the internal GitHub Packages offering.
